# pipette-tip-sorter

This project is a remix of [Vapecream's design on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/896781-modular-pippette-tip-sorting-box) but has been re-written to be parametric, and easily customised.  

The STL files provided use parameters for 200µl tips but there are dimensions for 10µl pipettes included in the SCAD file.
    - _Note that the 10µl designs are not perfected and still have issues that need more testing_  

### Assembly:
To attach the lid to the box, feed a length of 1.75mm PLA filament through the hinge parts and use a soldering iron / hot tool to flatten the ends so it does not fall out.
Stiff wire also works.  

### Usage:
1) Slide the upper comb into the box.  
1) Put between 30 to 40 tips into the box.

1) Shake the box until most of the pipettes have fallen into place. You may have to help some of them.

1) Once the tips are sitting in the upper comb, slide them towards the lid.

1) Add 20 to 30 more tips and repeat the process of shaking and sliding until all the tips are in the box.

1) Once you have enough tips, slide the lower comb into the gap underneath the upper comb to align the pipettes for the box the pipettes will be placed into.

1) Once the lower comb is fully inserted check the pipettes to see if any of them have gone into the same row.  
1) Now slightly shake the lower comb to make sure that all of the pipettes are straight to fit in the box correctly.  
1) Now get the box that will that the pipettes will be placed in and make sure all the pipettes line up when lowering the pipettes into the box.  
1) Once the pipettes are lined up with the box, then whilst holding the upper comb, slide out the pipettes with the lower comb.  
1) Now pull out the lower comb from the pipettes and the pipettes should fall into place in the box.
