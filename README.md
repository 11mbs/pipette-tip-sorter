# pipette-tip-sorter

This project is a remix of [Vapecream's design on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/896781-modular-pippette-tip-sorting-box) but has been re-written to be parametric, and easily customised.  

The STL files provided use parameters for 200µl tips but there are dimensions for 10µl pipettes included in the SCAD file.
    - _Note that the 10µl designs are not perfected and still have issues that need more testing_  

### Assembly:
To attach the lid to the box, feed a length of 1.75mm PLA filament through the hinge parts and use a soldering iron / hot tool to flatten the ends so it does not fall out.
Stiff wire also works.  

### Usage:
1) Slide the upper comb into the box.  
1) Put between 30 to 40 tips into the box.

1) Shake the box until most of the pipettes have fallen into place. You may have to help some of them.

1) Once the tips are sitting in the upper comb, slide them towards the lid.

1) Add 20 to 30 more tips and repeat the process of shaking and sliding until all the tips are in the box.

1) Once you have enough tips, slide the lower comb into the gap underneath the upper comb to align the pipettes for the box the pipettes will be placed into.

1) Once the lower comb is fully inserted check if any tips are squeezed into the same slot. You can pick these out manually or retry the lower comb if there are too many.

1) Slightly shake the lower comb so all the tips are aligned to fit in the box correctly.

1) Make sure all the pipettes line up when lowering into the cassette / tip box.

1) Hold both combs and slide them apart, keeping the lower comb and tips in place.

1) Carefully slide out the lower comb and the tips should fall into place.
