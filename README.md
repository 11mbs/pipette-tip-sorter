# pipette-tip-sorter

The original design is from Vapecream (https://www.printables.com/model/896781-modular-pippette-tip-sorting-box) but on this version the SCAD code has been re-written with variables and for loops which would allow you to easily change the various dimentions of the model for different sizes of pipettes or to change the size of the box.

This pipette tip sorter is designed for 200µL but there are dimentions for 10µL pipettes in the SCAD file.

You can use filliment for the lid hinge which you could use a soldering to melt the pastic in place to ensure that the filliment does not fall out.

(1) Slide in the upper comb into the box.
(2) Put between 30 to 40 pipettes into the box.
(3) Shake the box until most of the pipettes have fallen into place and you may have to help some of the pipettes.
(4) Once all of the pipettes are in the upper comb, move all the pipettes to the front (the lid).
(5) Now put 20 to 30 more pipettes and repeat the process until all the pipettes are in the box.
(6) Once you have put all the pipettes into the box, get the lower comb and slide the comb into the gap underneath the upper comb to align the pipettes for the box the pipettes will be placed into.
(7) Once the lower comb is fully inserted check the pipettes to see if any of them have gone into the same row.
(8) Now slightly shake the lower comb to make sure that all of the pipettes are straight to fit in the box correctly.
(9) Now get the box that will that the pipettes will be placed in and make sure all the pipettes line up when lowering the pipettes into the box.
(10) Once the pipettes are lined up with the box, then whilst holding the upper comb, slide out the pipettes with the lower comb.
(11) Now pull out the lower comb from the pipettes and the pipettes should fall into place in the box.
